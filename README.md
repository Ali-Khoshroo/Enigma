# Enigma
An Enigma machine is a famous encryption machine used by the Germans during WWII to transmit coded messages. An Enigma machine allows for billions and billions of ways to encode a message, making it incredibly difficult for other nations to crack German codes during the war ( for a time the code seemed unbreakable ).

## Why was Enigma so hard to break?
The number of permutations of settings available to the encoders made the Enigma code difficult to break. The operator set the machineâ€™s rotating wheels and plugboard to different predetermined positions according to daily orders, regularly changing the cipher.

## Mathematical analysis
Combining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has `158,962,555,217,826,360,000` different settings ( *nearly 159 quintillion or about 67 bits* ).

## How my code works
### First Run `Machine.py`    
The machine has a number of settings. You give the settings to the machine and then your message.   
The machine encrypts the message and if you enter the encrypted message ,decrypts it ( The setting should be the exact same to decrypt the message )   
### Settings that you can use :   
+ *plugboard :*  
The plugboard has `26 letters` and you can switch up to `10 pairs` of letters  
+ *Rotors :*  
There are `5 Rotors`  which you can choose `3` of them  
+ *Reflector :*  
There are `3 reflectors` which you can choose `1`  
+ *Message Key :*  
It is a `3 letter key` ( example : CWF )
